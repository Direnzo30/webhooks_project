# Webhooks

The most simple project management tool in the world for which we're going to develop
a webhook delivery system.

It doesn't even have authorization ðŸ˜±.

## Installation

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:drop db:setup
```

Let's make sure everything is ready.

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

You're good to go. Happy coding ðŸ¤˜!
